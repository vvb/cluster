#Contiv Cluster Manager Roadmap

This documents contains the features that are mandatory for cluster manager to
be considered functionally complete. This is more of a todo list and shall be
obsoleted once we have milestone/release level feature tracking in place.

**Note:** This doesn't tracks bugs and requests for features that are good to
have. They shall be tracked through github issues.

- [ ] cluster manager to provide APIs for batched node operations
- [x] cluster manager to accept it's configuration as command line arguments
- [ ] cluster manager to allow changing some of the configuration without requiring
      a restart.
- [ ] auto commission of nodes
- [x] cluster manager to accept values for ansible specific group-vars etc as part of
      command line
- [ ] ability to assign roles/group to commissioned nodes both statically and dynamically
- [ ] harden the node lifecycle especially to deal with failures
- [ ] ansible playbooks to provision 
  - [x] netmaster/netplugin service
    - [ ] host level network configuration like bundling NICs
    - [x] ovs
  - [ ] volmaster/volplugin service
    - [ ] ceph
  - [x] etcd datastore
  - [ ] consul datastore
  - [x] VIP service for high availability.
  - [x] docker stack including daemon, swarm
  - [x] orca containers
  - [x] cluster manager
    - [x] collins
    - [ ] mysql over ceph storage
  - [ ] what else?
- [ ] ansible playbooks for upgrade, cleanup and verify the above services
- [x] add system-tests
- [x] configuration steps for control/first node. The first node is special, so need a
      special way to commission it. For instance, collins is started as a container on it,
      we need to figure a way to keep it running when the control node is commissioned
     (which may restart docker)
     - This is addressed for now by fixing the ansible playbook for docker to not restart
       it if it is not needed. Revisit in case that is no longer a good fix.
